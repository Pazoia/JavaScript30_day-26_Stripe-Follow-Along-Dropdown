# Wes Bos JavaScript30 - Challenge 26

In this challenge we are exploring the Nav Bar  
further.

In this project we create an Nav Bar in which each dropdown  
has a background that adapts to the contents size and height.

Features:  
* Background follows mouse move when hovering over  
  dropdown menus
* Background that resizes according to content
